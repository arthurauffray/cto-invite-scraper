# CTO.new Invite Scraper Bot

A Discord selfbot that monitors the CTO.new invite sharing channel and automatically attempts to redeem invite codes when they're posted.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Disclaimers

- **Selfbots are against Discord's Terms of Service.** Use at your own risk.
- This is for educational purposes. You're responsible for any consequences.
- The bot uses your Discord account, so make sure you understand the risks.

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone/Download the Project

```bash
cd cto-invite-scraper
npm install
```

### 3. Get Your Discord Token
1. Open Discord in your web browser (not the app)
2. Press `F12` to open Developer Tools
3. Go to the `Network` tab
4. Refresh the page or click around Discord
5. Look for any request and find the `Authorization` header
6. Copy the token (it starts with your user ID and contains dots)

### 4. Get Your CTO.new Auth Token
1. Go to [cto.new](https://cto.new) and log in
2. Press `F12` to open Developer Tools

## üîß How It Works

1. **Connects to Discord** using your account as a selfbot
2. **Monitors the invite-sharing channel** (ID: 1428387946293362789)
3. **Detects invite codes** using regex pattern matching (12-character alphanumeric codes)
4. **Attempts redemption** via CTO.new's API
5. **Logs all activity** to the console with detailed status updates
